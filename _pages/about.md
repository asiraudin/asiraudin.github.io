I am a PhD student at RWTH Aachen, in the Learning on Graphs group, under the supervision of Christopher Morris. Before that, I studied at CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University) and Sorbonne University (Master M2A).

I am interested in graph machine learning, especially in the generative setting, with a particular focus on (discrete) diffusion models.
